**Problem Link:** [Second Largest & Second Smallest](https://www.codingninjas.com/studio/problems/ninja-and-the-second-order-elements_6581960?utm_source=striver&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=codestudio_a_zcourse)

You have been given an array ‘a’ of ‘n’ unique non-negative integers.
Find the second largest and second smallest element from the array.
Return the two elements (second largest and second smallest) as another array of size 2.

### Example 1:
Input: ‘n’ = 5, ‘a’ = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Output: [4, 2]  
Explanation: The second largest element is 4, and the second smallest element is 2.

### Expected Time Complexity:
O(n), Where ‘n’ is the size of an input array ‘arr’.

### Constraints:
2 ≤ 'n' ≤ 10^5  
0 ≤ 'a'[i] ≤ 10^9  
Time limit: 1 sec
