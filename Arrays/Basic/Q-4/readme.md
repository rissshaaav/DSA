You are given an array ‘arr’ containing ‘n’ integers. You are also given an integer ‘num’, and your task is to find whether ‘num’ is present in the array or not.
If ‘num’ is present in the array, return the 0-based index of the first occurrence of ‘num’. Else, return -1.

### Example 1:
Input: ‘n’ = 5, ‘num’ = 4, 'arr' =  [6,7,8,4,1]  
Output: 3  
Explanation: 4 is present at the 3rd index.

### Expected Time Complexity:
O(n), Where ‘n’ is the size of an input array ‘arr’.

### Constraints:
1  <= 'n' <= 10^6  
1 <= 'arr'[i] <= 1000  
Time Limit: 1 sec
