Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

### Example:
Input: nums = [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]  
Output: 3  
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

### Expected Time Complexity:
O(n), Where ‘n’ is the size of an input array ‘arr’.

### Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105  
nums[i] is either 0 or 1
