# Pattern-6: Inverted Numbered Right Pyramid
**Problem Link:** [Inverted Numbered Right Pyramid](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/triangle-number-1661489840/1)

Geek is very fond of patterns. Once, his teacher gave him a pattern to solve. He gave Geek an integer n and asked him to build a pattern.  
Help Geek to build a star pattern.

### Example 1:
Input: 5  
Output:
<p>
1 2 3 4 5<br/>
1 2 3 4<br/>
1 2 3<br/>
1 2<br/>
1<br/>
</p>

### Your Task:
You don't need to input anything. Complete the function printTriangle() which takes  an integer n  as the input parameter and print the pattern.

### Constraints:
1<= N <= 20
